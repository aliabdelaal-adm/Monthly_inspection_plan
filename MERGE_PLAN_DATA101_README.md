# Merge plan-data101.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data101.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created merge script: `merge_plan_data101.py`
   - Based on existing `merge_plan_data100.py` script
   - Modified to merge `plan-data101.json` instead of other data files
   - Implements intelligent duplicate detection and avoidance for inspection entries
   - Merges inspectors, areas, shops, and bell notifications without duplicates

### 2. Executed merge operation
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251009_200855`
   - Merged all data from `plan-data101.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

### 3. Merge Results
   ```
   📝 New inspection entries added: 1
   👥 New inspectors added: 0
   🏘️  New areas added: 0
   🏪 New shops added: 0
   🔔 New notifications added: 0
   ```

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 82 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 23 areas
- 149 shops
- 1 bell notification (with 4 notification items)

**plan-data101.json:**
- 83 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 23 areas
- 149 shops
- 1 bell notification

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 1 new inspection entry added (for October 10, 2025)
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new areas (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already present)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **83 inspection entries**
- 👥 **9 inspectors**
- 🏘️  **23 areas**
- 🏪 **149 shops**
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications**
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-09T20:08:55.500234

## Key Points

1. **No data loss**: All existing data in `plan-data.json` was preserved
2. **Duplicate prevention**: The merge script checks for duplicates using a composite key (inspector + day + shift + area)
3. **Automatic backup**: A timestamped backup was created before merging
4. **Data integrity**: All JSON structure and required fields are intact
5. **Shift support**: Same shop can be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts on the same day

## New Inspection Entry Added

The following inspection entry was added from `plan-data101.json`:

**Inspector:** د. آيه سلامة
- **Date:** 2025-10-10
- **Shift:** صباحية (Morning)
- **Area:** سوق التراث
- **Shops:** 5 shops including:
  - عيادة لايف لاين
  - محل البستان للطيور
  - محل زون تايم للطيور
  - محل العندليب للأسماك
  - محل بيتسي للحيوانات الأليفة

## Verification

To verify the merge was successful, you can check:

```bash
# Check the merged data
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('plan-data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(f'Inspections: {len(data[\"inspectionData\"])}, Inspectors: {len(data[\"inspectors\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Inspections: 83, Inspectors: 9`

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with:
- All inspection schedules (83 total entries)
- 9 official inspector assignments
- All connected to their respective inspection schedules
- Area information (23 areas)
- Shop details (149 shops)
- Bell notifications (4 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_data101.py` script as a template:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data101.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-data101.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
- The merged data is immediately available to `index.html` without any code changes required
- The script allows shops to be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts on the same day
