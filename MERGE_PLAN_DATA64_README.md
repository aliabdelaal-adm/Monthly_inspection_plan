# Merge plan-data64.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data64.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

## Merge Operation Details

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Script:** `merge_plan_data64.py`  
**Source File:** `plan-data64.json`  
**Target File:** `plan-data.json`  
**Backup Created:** `plan-data.json.backup_20251006_134236`

## Data Verification

### Before Merge
**plan-data.json:**
- 📝 55 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️  23 areas
- 🏪 142 shops
- 🔔 4 bell notifications

**plan-data64.json:**
- 📝 55 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️  23 areas
- 🏪 142 shops
- 🔔 4 bell notifications

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)
**Total counts:**
- 📝 **55 inspection entries** (0 new entries added - data was already synchronized)
- 👥 **9 inspectors** (no changes)
- 🏘️  **23 areas** (no changes)
- 🏪 **142 shops** (no changes)
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications** (no changes)
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-06T13:42:36.499188

## Merge Results

The merge operation successfully consolidated data from both files:
- ✅ **0 new inspection entries** added (files were already synchronized)
- ✅ **0 new inspectors** added
- ✅ **0 new areas** added
- ✅ **0 new shops** added
- ✅ **0 new notifications** added
- ✅ **Timestamp updated** to reflect the merge operation

## Key Points

1. **Data Synchronization**: Both files contained identical data, differing only in the `lastUpdate` timestamp
2. **Smart Merging**: The script identifies duplicates by checking the combination of `inspector|day|shift|area` to avoid duplicate inspection entries
3. **No Data Loss**: All data from plan-data64.json was verified to already exist in plan-data.json
4. **Data Integrity**: All data structures remain intact and properly formatted
5. **Front Screen Ready**: The merged data is now available in plan-data.json for index.html to read and display

## Verification

✅ Successfully loaded plan-data.json  
✅ All required keys present (inspectionData, inspectors, areas, shops, bellNotes, lastUpdate)  
✅ All required fields present in inspection entries (inspector, day, shift, area, shops)  
✅ All required fields present in bell notifications (id, text, timestamp, author)  
✅ Data structure is fully compatible with index.html  

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (55 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (9 inspectors)
- Area information (23 areas)
- Shop details (142 shops)
- Bell notifications (4 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_data64.py` script or create a similar script:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data64.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-data64.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Files Modified

- ✅ `plan-data.json` - Updated with merged data and new timestamp
- ✅ `plan-data.json.backup_20251006_134236` - Backup created before merge

## Next Steps

1. ✅ The merged data is ready to be displayed by index.html
2. ✅ All inspection plans are available for viewing
3. ✅ The application can be accessed and will show all consolidated data

## Technical Notes

- The merge script uses the same proven algorithm as previous merge operations (merge_plan_data.py, merge_plan_data3.py)
- Duplicate detection is based on the unique combination of inspector, day, shift, and area
- All data types (inspectors, areas, shops, bell notifications) are merged with ID-based duplicate prevention
- UTF-8 encoding is properly handled for Arabic text content
- Automatic backup ensures data safety before any modifications
