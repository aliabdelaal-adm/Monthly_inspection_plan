# Merge plan-data10.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data10.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created merge script: `merge_plan_data10.py`
   - Based on existing `merge_plan_data91.py` script
   - Modified to merge `plan-data10.json` instead of other data files
   - Implements intelligent duplicate detection and avoidance for inspection entries
   - Removed overly strict duplicate shop validation (same shop can be inspected in different shifts)

### 2. Executed merge operation
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251008_143241`
   - Merged all data from `plan-data10.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

### 3. Merge Results
   ```
   📝 New inspection entries added: 6
   👥 New inspectors added: 0
   🏘️  New areas added: 6
   🏪 New shops added: 0
   🔔 New notifications added: 0
   ```

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 75 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 30 areas
- 142 shops
- 4 bell notifications

**plan-data10.json:**
- 73 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 29 areas
- 142 shops
- 4 bell notifications

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 6 new inspection entries added (for October 10, 2025)
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 6 new areas added
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already present)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **81 inspection entries**
- 👥 **9 inspectors**
- 🏘️  **36 areas**
- 🏪 **142 shops**
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications**
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-08T14:32:41.455534

## Key Points

1. **No data loss**: All existing data in `plan-data.json` was preserved
2. **Duplicate prevention**: The merge script checks for duplicates using a composite key (inspector + day + shift + area)
3. **Automatic backup**: A timestamped backup was created before merging
4. **Data integrity**: All JSON structure and required fields are intact
5. **Shift support**: Same shop can be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts on the same day

## New Inspection Entries Added

All 6 new inspection entries are scheduled for **October 10, 2025**:

1. **د. آمنه بن صرم** - Morning shift - area_1758831360486 (5 shops)
2. **د. حسينة العامري** - Morning shift - area_1758839345230 (3 shops)
3. **د. حصة العلي** - Morning shift - area_1758831340793 (5 shops)
4. **د. علي عبدالعال** - Morning shift - area_1758913423620 (6 shops)
5. **د. محمد سعيد** - Evening shift - area_1758839353326 (5 shops)
6. **د. محمد إسماعيل** - Evening shift - area_1758831328093 (5 shops)

## New Areas Added

The following 6 new areas were added from `plan-data10.json`:
1. area_1758831360486 (ID: area_1759932183820)
2. area_1758839345230 (ID: area_1759932266870)
3. area_1758831340793 (ID: area_1759932485052)
4. area_1758839353326 (ID: area_1759932597806)
5. area_1758913423620 (ID: area_1759932745921)
6. area_1758831328093 (ID: area_1759933076366)

Note: These areas appear to have IDs as names, which may indicate they need proper Arabic names to be assigned in the admin panel.

## Verification

To verify the merge was successful, you can check:

```bash
# Check the merged data
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('plan-data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(f'Inspections: {len(data[\"inspectionData\"])}, Areas: {len(data[\"areas\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Inspections: 81, Areas: 36`

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (81 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (9 inspectors)
- Area information (36 areas)
- Shop details (142 shops)
- Bell notifications (4 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_data10.py` script as a template:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data10.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-data10.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
- The merged data is immediately available to `index.html` without any code changes required
- The script allows shops to be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts on the same day
