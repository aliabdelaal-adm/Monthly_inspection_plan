# Merge plan-data11.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data11.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file.

## What Was Done

1. **Created merge script**: `merge_plan_data11.py`
   - Based on existing merge scripts pattern
   - Modified to merge `plan-data11.json` instead of other data files
   - Uses intelligent duplicate detection to avoid data duplication
   - Enhanced validation to only block merges if NEW duplicates are introduced

2. **Executed merge operation**
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251008_144044`
   - Merged all data from `plan-data11.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 75 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 30 areas
- 142 shops
- 4 bell notifications

**plan-data11.json:**
- 77 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 30 areas
- 142 shops
- 4 bell notifications

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 2 new inspection entries added
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new areas (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already present)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **77 inspection entries** (increased from 75)
- 👥 **9 inspectors**
- 🏘️  **30 areas**
- 🏪 **142 shops**
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications**
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-08T14:40:44.660372

## New Inspection Entries Added

The following 2 new inspection entries were added from `plan-data11.json`:

1. **د. محمد سعيد** on **2025-10-11** (صباحية shift) assigned to area **area_1758839353326** (سوق التراث)
2. **د. محمد إسماعيل** on **2025-10-11** (مسائية shift) assigned to area **area_1758839353326** (سوق التراث)

## Key Points

1. **No data loss**: All existing data in `plan-data.json` was preserved
2. **Duplicate prevention**: The merge script checks for duplicates using a composite key (inspector + day + shift + area)
3. **Automatic backup**: A timestamped backup was created before merging
4. **Data integrity**: All JSON structure and required fields are intact
5. **Pre-existing duplicates**: Both files contained 15 pre-existing duplicate shop assignments which were preserved (not introduced by the merge)

## Verification

The merged data has been verified to:
- ✅ Contain all required fields (`inspectionData`, `inspectors`, `areas`, `shops`, `bellNotes`, `lastUpdate`)
- ✅ Have proper JSON structure that can be loaded by the application
- ✅ Include all inspection entries with required fields (inspector, day, shift, area, shops)
- ✅ Be compatible with `index.html` which loads data from `./plan-data.json`

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data is now available to the main front screen and includes all:
- Inspection schedules from both files
- Inspector assignments
- Area information
- Shop details
- Bell notifications

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_data11.py` script as a template:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data11.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-data11.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The merged data is immediately available to `index.html` without any code changes required
- Pre-existing duplicate shop assignments (15 total) were detected but did not block the merge since they existed in both source files before the merge operation
