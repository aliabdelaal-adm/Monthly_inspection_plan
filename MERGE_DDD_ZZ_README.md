# Merge plan-dataddd.json and plan-datazz.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-dataddd.json` and `plan-datazz.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created merge_two_files.py Script
Created a new merge script specifically designed to merge both source files sequentially:
- Processes `plan-dataddd.json` first
- Then processes `plan-datazz.json`
- Intelligently merges all data types (inspection data, inspectors, areas, shops, notifications)
- Avoids duplicates using key-based comparison
- Reports conflicts when found

### 2. Executed Merge Operation
Ran the merge script which:
- Created automatic backup: `plan-data.json.backup_20251002_205820`
- Merged all unique data from both source files into `plan-data.json`
- Avoided duplicates using intelligent key-based comparison
- Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

### 3. Cleaned Up Duplicate Notifications
Removed duplicate notification entry that existed in the original plan-data.json:
- Found and removed 1 duplicate notification with ID `textarea_1758999202029`
- Kept only unique notification entries

## Data Verification

### Source Files Analysis

**plan-dataddd.json:**
- 44 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 22 areas
- 114 shops
- 5 bell notifications

**plan-datazz.json:**
- 44 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 22 areas
- 114 shops
- 5 bell notifications

**Key Difference:** 
The files had ONE different inspection entry:
- **plan-dataddd.json**: د. آمنه بن صرم on 2025-10-03 (صباحية shift) assigned to سوق التراث area
- **plan-datazz.json**: د. آمنه بن صرم on 2025-10-03 (صباحية shift) assigned to الحصن area

The current plan-data.json already had the الحصن assignment, so the سوق التراث assignment from plan-dataddd.json was added as a new entry.

### Merge Results

**From plan-dataddd.json:**
- ✅ 1 new inspection entry added
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new areas (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 2 new bell notifications added

**From plan-datazz.json:**
- ✅ 0 new inspection entries (all already present or conflicting)
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new areas (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already added from dataddd)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **45 inspection entries** (increased from 44)
- 👥 **9 inspectors**
- 🏘️  **22 areas**
- 🏪 **114 shops**
- 🔔 **5 bell notifications** (increased from 4, after removing duplicate)
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-02T20:58:20.763704

## Key Points

1. **New Inspection Entry**: Added د. آمنه بن صرم's inspection for 2025-10-03 (صباحية) in سوق التراث area from plan-dataddd.json
2. **Notification Handling**: Added 2 new unique notifications from the source files and removed 1 duplicate
3. **Data Integrity**: All data structures remain intact and properly formatted
4. **Duplicate Detection**: The merge detected 14 shops assigned to multiple inspectors on the same day (this appears to be intentional for team inspections)
5. **Front Screen Ready**: The merged data is now available in plan-data.json for the application to read and display

## Verification

✅ Successfully merged both source files  
✅ All required keys present  
✅ All required fields present in inspection entries  
✅ All required fields present in notifications  
✅ All unique data from both source files is present in merged file  
✅ Duplicate notification removed  
✅ Total inspection entries increased from 44 to 45  
✅ Total notifications increased from 4 to 5 (after cleanup)

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (including the new entry from plan-dataddd.json)
- Inspector assignments
- Area information
- Shop details
- Bell notifications (now 5 total, with duplicates removed)

## New Inspection Entry Details

**Added from plan-dataddd.json:**
```json
{
  "inspector": "د. آمنه بن صرم",
  "day": "2025-10-03",
  "shift": "صباحية",
  "area": "سوق التراث",
  "shops": [
    "محل البستان للطيور",
    "محل الياقوت للطيور",
    "محل تويتر غاليري",
    "محل زون تايم للطيور",
    "محل فالكون لتجارة الأسماك"
  ]
}
```

Note: This inspector now has TWO assignments for the same day and shift in different areas (سوق التراث and الحصن).

## New Notifications Added

Two notifications were added from the source files:
1. **ID: 1759437746479** - by خديجة المنصوري (about inspection stickers)
2. **ID: 1759437656330** - by د. حسينة العامري (about worker vaccination records)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_two_files.py` script:
```bash
python3 merge_two_files.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from both source files
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Report conflicts (if any)
5. Update timestamps
6. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script is specifically designed for merging `plan-dataddd.json` and `plan-datazz.json`
- For merging other files, modify the script's `main()` function to specify different source files
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging individual files
- Both source files (`plan-dataddd.json` and `plan-datazz.json`) remain unchanged and can serve as reference
