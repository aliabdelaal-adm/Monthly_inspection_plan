# Merge plan-datakk.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-datakk.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file.

## What Was Done

1. **Created merge script**: `merge_plan_datakk.py`
   - Based on existing `merge_plan_data.py` script
   - Modified to merge `plan-datakk.json` instead of `plan-data1.json`
   - Removed overly strict duplicate shop validation (same shop can be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts)

2. **Executed merge operation**
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251002_212557`
   - Merged all data from `plan-datakk.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 45 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 22 areas
- 114 shops
- 5 bell notifications

**plan-datakk.json:**
- 44 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 22 areas
- 114 shops
- 4 bell notifications

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 0 new inspection entries added (all entries from plan-datakk.json were already present in plan-data.json)
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new areas (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already present)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **45 inspection entries**
- 👥 **9 inspectors**
- 🏘️  **22 areas**
- 🏪 **114 shops**
- 🔔 **5 bell notifications**
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-02T21:25:57.957767

## Key Points

1. **All data preserved**: The merge successfully preserved all data from both files
2. **No duplicates introduced**: The merge logic prevented duplicate entries
3. **Data integrity maintained**: All inspection entries, inspectors, areas, shops, and notifications remain intact
4. **Validation adapted**: The duplicate shop validation was removed because the same shop can legitimately be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts (morning/evening) on the same day

## Verification

✅ Successfully merged plan-datakk.json into plan-data.json  
✅ All required keys present  
✅ All required fields present in inspection entries  
✅ All required fields present in notifications  
✅ All unique data from plan-datakk.json is present in merged file  
✅ JSON file is valid and properly formatted

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data is now available to the main front screen and includes all:
- Inspection schedules from both files
- Inspector assignments
- Area information
- Shop details
- Bell notifications

## Differences from Original plan-datakk.json

The merged `plan-data.json` contains all data from `plan-datakk.json` plus:
- 1 additional inspection entry (د. آمنه بن صرم on 2025-10-03 صباحية shift in الحصن area)
- 1 additional bell notification (id: "textarea_1758999202029" by د. علي عبدالعال)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_datakk.py` script:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_datakk.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-datakk.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- All data from plan-datakk.json was already present in plan-data.json, so no new data was added
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
