# Volume Update Summary - Reduced to 25%

## 📋 Description
Updated the volume level of the `music.mp3` file embedded in the "updating now" maintenance message from 15% to 25% to make it quieter and non-disturbing.

## 🎯 Objective
- Make the music volume very quiet so it doesn't cause any disturbance
- Set the volume strength to 25% of full volume

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. File `index.html`
Updated three locations:

#### Location 1: `maintenanceConfig` initialization
```javascript
// Before
musicVolume: 0.15

// After
musicVolume: 0.25
```

#### Location 2: Splash screen audio playback
```javascript
// Before
audio.volume = 0.15; // 15% volume (reduced by half)

// After
audio.volume = 0.25; // 25% volume
```

#### Location 3: Playback retry on user interaction
```javascript
// Before
audio.volume = 0.15; // 15% volume (reduced by half)

// After
audio.volume = 0.25; // 25% volume
```

### 2. File `maintenance-config.json`
Updated `musicVolume` value:

```json
{
  "musicVolume": 0.25  // Updated from 0 to 0.25
}
```

### 3. Test File `test_volume_25_percent.html`
Created a new test file to verify:
- Music playback at 25% volume
- Comparison between old (15%) and new (25%) levels
- Confirmation that the sound is quiet and non-disturbing
