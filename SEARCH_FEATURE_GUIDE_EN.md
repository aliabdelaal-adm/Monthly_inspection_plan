# Shop Search Feature in New Inspection Form 🔍

## Overview
A powerful search feature has been added to the "Add New Inspection" form in the Smart Planner tool, allowing developers to quickly find specific shops when creating new inspection plans.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Criteria Search
Search shops by:
- ✅ Shop name (Arabic/English)
- ✅ License number
- ✅ ADM code
- ✅ Activity type
- ✅ Address

### 2. Real-Time Filtering
- Instant results as you type
- Case-insensitive search
- Partial matching support
- No page reload required

### 3. Smart Integration
- Automatically appears when shops are displayed
- Clears when filters change (inspector/date/area)
- Hides when no shops are available
- Works with existing priority filters

## How to Use

### Basic Steps
1. Navigate to "Add New Inspection" tab in `smart-planner.html`
2. Select inspector, date, and area
3. Use the search box that appears above the shops list
4. Type shop name, license number, or ADM code
5. View filtered results instantly

### Search Examples
- **By Name**: Type "الرحمة" to find "محل الرحمة للحيوانات الأليفة"
- **By License**: Type "12345" to find shop with license number 12345
- **By ADM Code**: Type "ADM-001" to find shop with that code
- **Partial Match**: Type "حيوانات" to find all shops with "حيوانات" in name or activity

## Technical Details

### Implementation
- **File Modified**: `smart-planner.html`
- **New Function**: `filterInspectionShops()`
- **New UI Elements**: 
  - `inspectionShopSearchBox` - Search container
  - `inspectionShopSearch` - Input field

### Search Logic
```javascript
function filterInspectionShops() {
    const searchTerm = document.getElementById('inspectionShopSearch').value.toLowerCase().trim();
    const shopCards = document.querySelectorAll('#shopsListContainer .shop-card');
    
    // Filter shop cards based on search term
    shopCards.forEach(card => {
        const shopName = card.querySelector('.shop-name').textContent.toLowerCase();
        
        // Get additional details from shopsDetails if available
        let shopDetails = '';
        const originalShopName = card.querySelector('.shop-name').textContent;
        if (shopsDetails && shopsDetails[originalShopName]) {
            const shop = shopsDetails[originalShopName];
            shopDetails = [
                shop.nameEn || '',
                shop.licenseNo || '',
                shop.admCode || '',
                shop.activity || '',
                shop.address || ''
            ].join(' ').toLowerCase();
        }
        
        // Show/hide based on match
        const searchableText = shopName + ' ' + shopDetails;
        card.style.display = searchableText.includes(searchTerm) ? '' : 'none';
    });
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Display Function**: Modified `displayShops()` to show/hide search box
- **Update Function**: Modified `updateAvailableShops()` to clear search on filter change
- **Reset Function**: Modified `resetForm()` to clear search input
