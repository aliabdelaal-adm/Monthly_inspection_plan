# Merge plan-dataALI.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-dataALI.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

## What Was Done

1. **Created merge script**: `merge_plan_dataALI.py`
   - Based on existing merge scripts pattern (merge_plan_data12.py)
   - Modified to merge `plan-dataALI.json` instead of other data files
   - Uses intelligent duplicate detection to avoid data duplication
   - Validates that no new duplicate shop assignments are introduced

2. **Executed merge operation**
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251012_120332`
   - Merged all data from `plan-dataALI.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 121 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 23 areas
- 149 shops
- 1 bell notification

**plan-dataALI.json:**
- 121 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 23 areas
- 149 shops
- 1 bell notification

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 0 new inspection entries added (both files contained identical data)
- ✅ 0 new inspectors (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new areas (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already present)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **121 inspection entries**
- 👥 **9 inspectors**
- 🏘️  **23 areas**
- 🏪 **149 shops**
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications**
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-12T12:03:32.132659

## Key Points

1. **No data loss**: All existing data in `plan-data.json` was preserved
2. **Duplicate prevention**: The merge script checks for duplicates using a composite key (inspector + day + shift + area)
3. **Automatic backup**: A timestamped backup was created before merging
4. **Data integrity**: All JSON structure and required fields are intact
5. **Identical data**: Both files contained the same data, so no new entries were added

## Verification

The merged data has been verified to:
- ✅ Contain all required fields (`inspectionData`, `inspectors`, `areas`, `shops`, `bellNotes`, `lastUpdate`)
- ✅ Have proper JSON structure that can be loaded by the application
- ✅ Include all inspection entries with required fields (inspector, day, shift, area, shops)
- ✅ Be compatible with `index.html` which loads data from `./plan-data.json`

To verify the merge was successful, you can check:

```bash
# Check the merged data
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('plan-data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(f'Inspections: {len(data[\"inspectionData\"])}, Areas: {len(data[\"areas\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Inspections: 121, Areas: 23`

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (121 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (9 inspectors)
- Area information (23 areas)
- Shop details (149 shops)
- Bell notifications (4 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_dataALI.py` script as a template:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_dataALI.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-dataALI.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
- The merged data is immediately available to `index.html` without any code changes required
- In this case, both files contained identical data, demonstrating the script's ability to handle duplicate data gracefully
