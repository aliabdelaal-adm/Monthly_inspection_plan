# Merge plan-data222.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data222.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file.

## What Was Done

### 1. Modified merge_plan_data.py
Updated the merge script to process `plan-data222.json` instead of `plan-dataAli1.json`:
- Changed source file from `plan-dataAli1.json` to `plan-data222.json`
- Updated documentation strings

### 2. Executed Merge Operation
Ran the merge script which:
- Created automatic backup: `plan-data.json.backup_20250930_195541`
- Merged all data from `plan-data222.json` into `plan-data.json`
- Avoided duplicates using intelligent key-based comparison
- Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

### 3. Merge Results

## Data Verification

### Before Merge (from backup)
- **lastUpdate**: 2025-09-30T18:09:09.455529
- **inspectionData**: 44 entries
- **inspectors**: 9
- **areas**: 22
- **shops**: 114
- **notifications**: 4

### Source File (plan-data222.json)
- **lastUpdate**: 2025-09-30T19:50:04.745Z (newer than original)
- **inspectionData**: 44 entries
- **inspectors**: 9
- **areas**: 22
- **shops**: 114
- **notifications**: 3

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)
- **lastUpdate**: 2025-09-30T19:55:41.468821 (merge timestamp)
- **inspectionData**: 44 entries
- **inspectors**: 9
- **areas**: 22
- **shops**: 114
- **notifications**: 4 (preserved from main file)

## Key Points

1. **No Duplicates**: All inspection data, inspectors, areas, and shops from plan-data222.json were already present in plan-data.json
2. **Notification Handling**: The merge preserved all 4 notifications from the original plan-data.json, including one that was not in plan-data222.json
3. **Data Integrity**: All data structures remain intact and properly formatted
4. **Front Screen Ready**: The merged data is now available in plan-data.json for the application to read and display

## Verification

✅ Successfully loaded plan-data.json  
✅ All required keys present  
✅ All required fields present in inspection entries  
✅ All required fields present in notifications  
✅ All inspection data from plan-data222.json is present in merged file  

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules
- Inspector assignments
- Area information
- Shop details
- Bell notifications

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, modify `merge_plan_data.py` to specify the source file and run:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently (avoiding duplicates)
3. Update timestamps
4. Provide detailed merge summary
