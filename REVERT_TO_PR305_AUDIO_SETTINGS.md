# 🔄 Revert to PR 305 Audio Settings

## 📋 Problem Statement

The audio file in the update message was not displaying well. The issue requested to change all settings and instructions for the audio file to match PR 305, which was displaying properly.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Audio Element (Line 2776)

#### Before (Current Implementation):
```html
<audio id="maintenanceAudio" autoplay muted loop preload="auto" style="display:none;">
```

#### After (PR 305 Settings):
```html
<audio id="maintenanceAudio" loop preload="auto" style="display:none;">
```

**Key Changes:**
- ❌ Removed `autoplay` attribute
- ❌ Removed `muted` attribute
- ✅ Kept `loop` attribute
- ✅ Kept `preload="auto"` attribute

**Why?**
- The `autoplay muted` approach causes issues on mobile devices
- Audio starts too early (on page load) instead of when maintenance message shows
- Unmuting often fails on mobile browsers due to autoplay policies

---

### 2. showMaintenanceMode() Function (Lines 5124-5152)

#### Before:
```javascript
// Unmute and adjust volume of maintenance music (audio is already autoplaying due to autoplay attribute)
const audio = document.getElementById('maintenanceAudio');
if (audio) {
    // Audio is already playing muted due to autoplay attribute
    // Simply unmute it and set appropriate volume
    audio.muted = false;
    audio.volume = 0.15; // Set volume to 15% for comfort
    audio.currentTime = 0; // Restart from beginning
    
    // Create a timer to stop audio after 1200 seconds (20 minutes)
    const playbackTimer = setTimeout(() => {
        audio.pause();
        audio.currentTime = 0;
        audio.muted = true; // Mute again for next time
        console.log('🎵 Maintenance music stopped after 1200 seconds');
    }, 1200000); // 1200 seconds = 20 minutes
    
    // Store timer ID for cleanup
    audio.setAttribute('data-timer-id', playbackTimer);
    
    console.log('🎵 Maintenance music unmuted and playing automatically');
}
```

#### After (PR 305):
```javascript
// Play maintenance music
const audio = document.getElementById('maintenanceAudio');
if (audio) {
    audio.volume = 0.15; // Set volume to 15% for comfort
    
    // Start muted first (best practice for autoplay)
    audio.muted = true;
    audio.play().then(() => {
        console.log('✅ Audio started playing (muted)');
        
        // Unmute after 50ms
        setTimeout(() => {
            audio.muted = false;
            console.log('✅ Audio unmuted successfully');
        }, 50);
    }).catch(err => {
        console.log('⚠️ Audio autoplay blocked. Waiting for user interaction...');
        
        // Strong fallback: play on user interaction
        const playOnInteraction = () => {
            audio.muted = false;
            audio.volume = 0.15;
            audio.currentTime = 0;
            audio.play().catch(e => console.log('Audio play failed:', e));
        };
        document.addEventListener('click', playOnInteraction, { once: true });
        document.addEventListener('touchstart', playOnInteraction, { once: true });
    });
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Audio starts ONLY when maintenance message shows (not on page load)
- ✅ Uses programmatic muted start → unmute pattern (best practice)
- ✅ Includes strong fallback for user interaction
- ✅ Works better on mobile devices
- ❌ Removed 20-minute timer (audio controlled by maintenance mode)

### 3. hideMaintenanceMode() Function (Lines 5166-5173)

#### Before:
```javascript
// Stop and reset maintenance music
const audio = document.getElementById('maintenanceAudio');
if (audio) {
    audio.pause();
    audio.currentTime = 0;
    audio.muted = true; // Mute for next time to allow autoplay
    
    // Clear the timer if it exists
    const timerId = audio.getAttribute('data-timer-id');
    if (timerId) {
        clearTimeout(parseInt(timerId));
        audio.removeAttribute('data-timer-id');
    }
    
    console.log('🎵 Maintenance music stopped and muted');
}
```

#### After (PR 305):
```javascript
// Stop and reset maintenance music
const audio = document.getElementById('maintenanceAudio');
if (audio) {
    audio.pause();
    audio.currentTime = 0;
    
    console.log('🎵 Maintenance music stopped');
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Simplified stop logic
- ❌ Removed mute reset (not needed without autoplay attribute)
- ❌ Removed timer cleanup (timer removed)
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler code

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why This Works Better

1. **No Premature Autoplay**
   - Audio doesn't start on page load
   - Starts only when needed
   - Better browser compliance

2. **Programmatic Muted Start**
   - Modern browsers allow muted audio.play()
   - We control the unmute timing (50ms)
   - More reliable than attribute-based autoplay

3. **Strong Fallback**
   - If .play() fails, wait for user interaction
   - Works on ALL browsers eventually
   - Better user experience

4. **Simpler State Management**
   - No complex timer logic
   - Audio state tied to maintenance mode
   - Easier to debug

---

## ✅ Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Desktop Chrome**
   - ✅ Audio plays immediately when maintenance shows
