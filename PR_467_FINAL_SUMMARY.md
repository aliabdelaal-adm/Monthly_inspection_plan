## What PR #467 Does NOT Include (Correctly Excluded)

### ❌ Area/Shop Management Features (Not Part of This PR)

The following were **incorrectly added** and have been **removed**:

**Smart Panel (smart-panel.html):**
- ❌ Add new shops to database
- ❌ Edit shop details (name, license, contact, etc.)
- ❌ Delete shops from database
- ❌ Add new areas to system
- ❌ Edit area names
- ❌ Delete areas from system
- ❌ Shop-area mapping management
- ❌ CRUD operations for shops/areas

**Why Removed:**
- Not part of PR #467 scope
- Not mentioned in SMART_PLANNER_DEMO.md
- Different feature set (data management vs. inspection planning)
- Should be a separate PR if needed
