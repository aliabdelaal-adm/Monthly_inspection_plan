## 🎨 Customization for Developers

### Change Detection Sensitivity

```javascript
// In smart-planner.html or test_hand_gesture_control.html
gestureThreshold = 0.15; // Default value
// Lower value = higher sensitivity (0.1)
// Higher value = lower sensitivity (0.2)
```

### Change Wait Time Between Gestures

```javascript
gestureDebounceDelay = 800; // Default 800 milliseconds
// Lower value = faster response (600)
// Higher value = slower but more accurate response (1000)
```

### Add New Gesture

```javascript
// In detectGesture function
if (fingersExtended === 3) { // Example: 3 fingers
    executeGesture('custom', 'Custom Gesture 👌', 'Action description');
    lastGestureTime = now;
}
```
