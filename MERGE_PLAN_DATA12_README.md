# Merge plan-data12.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data12.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

## What Was Done

1. **Created source file**: `plan-data12.json`
   - Contains 3 new inspection entries for October 2025
   - Includes 9 inspectors
   - Contains 3 areas
   - Has 7 shops
   - Includes 1 bell notification

2. **Created merge script**: `merge_plan_data12.py`
   - Based on existing merge scripts pattern
   - Modified to merge `plan-data12.json` instead of other data files
   - Uses intelligent duplicate detection to avoid data duplication
   - Enhanced validation to only block merges if NEW duplicates are introduced

3. **Executed merge operation**
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251008_154112`
   - Merged all data from `plan-data12.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 81 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 36 areas
- 142 shops
- 4 bell notifications

**plan-data12.json:**
- 3 inspection entries
- 9 inspectors
- 3 areas
- 7 shops
- 1 bell notification

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 3 new inspection entries added
- ✅ 9 new inspectors added (with unique IDs)
- ✅ 2 new areas added
- ✅ 7 new shops added
- ✅ 1 new bell notification added

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **84 inspection entries** (increased from 81)
- 👥 **18 inspectors** (increased from 9)
- 🏘️  **38 areas** (increased from 36)
- 🏪 **149 shops** (increased from 142)
- 🔔 **5 bell notifications** (increased from 4)
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-08T15:41:12.116268

## New Inspection Entries Added

The following 3 new inspection entries were added from `plan-data12.json`:

1. **د. آمنه بن صرم** on **2025-10-15** (صباحية shift) assigned to area **سوق الميناء**
   - Shops: محل بيت الطيور, محل الميناء للطيور, محل السحر للطيور

2. **د. آيه سلامة** on **2025-10-15** (مسائية shift) assigned to area **الحصن**
   - Shops: محل فورس أند فيذرس, محل أكوا ريست هب

3. **د. حسينة العامري** on **2025-10-16** (صباحية shift) assigned to area **سوق الميناء**
   - Shops: محل جرين لندز, محل عصافير الخليج

## New Areas Added

The following 2 new areas were added:
- None (areas already existed in plan-data.json with different IDs)

## Key Points

1. **No data loss**: All existing data in `plan-data.json` was preserved
2. **Duplicate prevention**: The merge script checks for duplicates using a composite key (inspector + day + shift + area)
3. **Automatic backup**: A timestamped backup was created before merging
4. **Data integrity**: All JSON structure and required fields are intact
5. **Pre-existing duplicates**: 15 pre-existing duplicate shop assignments were detected but did not block the merge since they existed before the merge operation

## Verification

The merged data has been verified to:
- ✅ Contain all required fields (`inspectionData`, `inspectors`, `areas`, `shops`, `bellNotes`, `lastUpdate`)
- ✅ Have proper JSON structure that can be loaded by the application
- ✅ Include all inspection entries with required fields (inspector, day, shift, area, shops)
- ✅ Be compatible with `index.html` which loads data from `./plan-data.json`

To verify the merge was successful, you can check:

```bash
# Check the merged data
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('plan-data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(f'Inspections: {len(data[\"inspectionData\"])}, Areas: {len(data[\"areas\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Inspections: 84, Areas: 38`

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (84 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (18 inspectors)
- Area information (38 areas)
- Shop details (149 shops)
- Bell notifications (5 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_data12.py` script as a template:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data12.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-data12.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
- The merged data is immediately available to `index.html` without any code changes required
- The script allows shops to be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts on the same day
