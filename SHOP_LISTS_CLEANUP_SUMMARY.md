## Results Summary

| File | Before | After | Deleted | Kept |
|------|--------|-------|---------|------|
| new-shop-list-updated.xlsx | 405 | 104 | 301 | 104 (yellow) |
| old-shop-list-updated.xlsx | 128 | 128 | 0 | 128 (all) |
| **Total** | **533** | **232** | **301** | **232** |

## Backup Files

Backup files were created before any modifications:
- `new-shop-list-updated_backup_20251022_214658.xlsx`
- `old-shop-list-updated_backup_20251022_214658.xlsx`

These backup files are stored locally but excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Verification

✅ All shops in new-shop-list-updated.xlsx are yellow-highlighted
✅ Old-shop-list-updated.xlsx remains unchanged with all 128 shops
✅ Total shop count: 232 shops across both files
✅ Backup files created successfully
✅ No security vulnerabilities detected

## Script Created

A Python script `cleanup_shop_lists.py` was created to automate this process. The script:
1. Creates backups before making changes
2. Identifies yellow-highlighted rows in Excel files
3. Removes non-highlighted rows from the new file
4. Preserves all formatting and column properties
5. Generates a summary report

## Note on Number Discrepancy

The problem statement mentioned:
- 107 yellow shops in new file (actual: 104)
- 173 shops in old file (actual: 128)

The script processed the actual data found in the files:
- 104 yellow-highlighted shops were kept in the new file
- All 128 shops were kept in the old file

## How to Run the Cleanup Script

```bash
python3 cleanup_shop_lists.py
```

The script will:
1. Create timestamped backups
2. Process both files
3. Display a summary of changes
