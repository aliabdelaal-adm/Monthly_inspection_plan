# Merge plan-datafayez.json into plan-data.json

## Overview

This document describes the successful merge of `plan-datafayez.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file, which is used by `index.html` to display inspection schedules.

## What Was Done

The `merge_plan_datafayez.py` script was created to safely merge data from `plan-datafayez.json` into `plan-data.json` while:
- Avoiding duplicate inspection entries
- Validating that no shop is assigned to multiple inspectors on the same day (for dates from October 7, 2024 onwards)
- Merging inspectors, areas, shops, and bell notifications without duplicates
- Creating automatic backups before merging

## Merge Results

### Files Involved
- **Source file**: `plan-datafayez.json` (127 inspection entries)
- **Target file**: `plan-data.json` (121 inspection entries before merge)
- **Backup created**: `plan-data.json.backup_20251012_230106`

### Data Added
- ✅ **6 new inspection entries** added to plan-data.json
- ✅ **0 new inspectors** (all inspectors already existed)
- ✅ **0 new areas** (all areas already existed)
- ✅ **0 new shops** (all shops already existed)
- ✅ **0 new notifications** (all notifications already existed)

### Final Counts After Merge
- 📝 Total inspection entries: **127**
- 👥 Total inspectors: **9**
- 🏘️ Total areas: **23**
- 🏪 Total shops: **149**
- 🔔 Total notifications: **4**
- 📅 Last update: **2025-10-12T23:01:06.812809**

## Data Validation

✅ **No duplicate shop assignments detected** - The merge passed validation ensuring no shop is assigned to multiple inspectors on the same day (for dates from October 7, 2024 onwards).

✅ **JSON structure is valid** - The merged file maintains the correct structure required by `index.html`:
```json
{
  "inspectionData": [...],
  "inspectors": [...],
  "areas": [...],
  "shops": [...],
  "bellNotes": {...},
  "lastUpdate": "2025-10-12T23:01:06.812809"
}
```

## How index.html Reads the Data

The application (`index.html`) loads inspection data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data is now available to `index.html` and will display all 127 inspection entries, including the 6 new entries from `plan-datafayez.json`.

## Verification

To verify the merge was successful, run:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('plan-data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(f'Total entries: {len(data[\"inspectionData\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Total entries: 127`

## Backup Location

Original plan-data.json backed up to:
- `plan-data.json.backup_20251012_230106`

This backup can be restored if needed by running:
```bash
cp plan-data.json.backup_20251012_230106 plan-data.json
```

## Usage

To merge additional data from `plan-datafayez.json` in the future, use:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_datafayez.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Validate for shop assignment conflicts
5. Update timestamps
6. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script follows the same pattern as other merge scripts in the repository (`merge_plan_data.py`, `merge_plan_data_hessa_aya_hassina.py`, etc.)
- Shop duplicate validation only applies to dates from October 7, 2024 onwards
- All data is preserved - no existing data was deleted or modified, only new entries were added
- The merged file is ready for immediate use by `index.html`

## Files Modified

- ✅ `plan-data.json` - Updated with merged data (121 → 127 entries)

## Files Created

- ✅ `merge_plan_datafayez.py` - Merge script
- ✅ `plan-data.json.backup_20251012_230106` - Backup file
- ✅ `MERGE_PLAN_DATAFAYEZ_README.md` - This documentation
