# Merge plan-datafayez.json into plan-data.json

## Overview

This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-datafayez.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Script:** `merge_plan_datafayez.py`  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully completed

## What Was Done

### 1. Created merge script: `merge_plan_datafayez.py`
   - Based on existing `merge_plan_data.py` script
   - Implements intelligent duplicate detection and avoidance
   - Validates for duplicate shop assignments on the same day (for dates >= Oct 7, 2024)
   - Provides detailed merge summary and error reporting

### 2. Executed merge operation
   - Created automatic backup: `plan-data.json.backup_20251011_225645`
   - Merged all unique data from `plan-datafayez.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Avoided duplicates using intelligent key-based comparison
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

## Merge Operation Details

**Command executed:**
```bash
python3 merge_plan_datafayez.py
```

**Merge results:**
- ✅ **3 new inspection entries** added
- ✅ **0 new inspectors** added (all inspectors already existed)
- ✅ **0 new areas** added (all areas already existed)
- ✅ **0 new shops** added (all shops already existed)
- ✅ **0 new bell notifications** added (all notifications already existed)

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 📝 110 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️  23 areas
- 🏪 149 shops
- 🔔 4 bell notifications

**plan-datafayez.json:**
- 📝 113 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️  23 areas
- 🏪 149 shops
- 🔔 4 bell notifications

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **113 inspection entries** (increased from 110)
- 👥 **9 inspectors** (no changes)
- 🏘️  **23 areas** (no changes)
- 🏪 **149 shops** (no changes)
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications** (no changes)
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-11T22:56:45.294020

## New Inspection Entries Added

The merge added **3 new inspection entries** that were unique to `plan-datafayez.json`:

1. Entry with unique inspector/day/shift/area combination
2. Entry with unique inspector/day/shift/area combination
3. Entry with unique inspector/day/shift/area combination

These entries represent inspection schedules that did not exist in the original `plan-data.json`.

## Key Points

- ✅ **No conflicts detected**: All data merged cleanly without duplicate shop assignments
- ✅ **Data integrity maintained**: Validation passed for duplicate shop detection
- ✅ **Backup created**: Original plan-data.json safely backed up before merge
- ✅ **Timestamp updated**: Last update timestamp reflects merge completion time
- ✅ **Compatible with index.html**: Merged data structure is fully compatible

## Verification

✅ Successfully loaded plan-data.json  
✅ All required keys present (inspectionData, inspectors, areas, shops, bellNotes, lastUpdate)  
✅ All required fields present in inspection entries (inspector, day, shift, area, shops)  
✅ All required fields present in bell notifications (id, text, timestamp, author)  
✅ Data structure is fully compatible with index.html  

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (113 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (9 inspectors)
- Area information (23 areas)
- Shop details (149 shops)
- Bell notifications (4 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_datafayez.py` script as a template:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_datafayez.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-datafayez.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Validate for duplicate shop assignments
5. Update timestamps
6. Provide detailed merge summary

## Files Modified

- ✅ `plan-data.json` - Updated with merged data and new timestamp
- ✅ `plan-data.json.backup_20251011_225645` - Backup created before merge
- ✅ `merge_plan_datafayez.py` - New merge script created

## Backup Location

Original plan-data.json backed up to:
- `plan-data.json.backup_20251011_225645`

This backup can be restored if needed by running:
```bash
cp plan-data.json.backup_20251011_225645 plan-data.json
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ The merged data is ready to be displayed by index.html
2. ✅ All inspection plans are available for viewing
3. ✅ The application can be accessed and will show all consolidated data

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
- The merged data is immediately available to `index.html` without any code changes required
- The script allows shops to be inspected by different inspectors in different shifts on the same day

## Technical Notes

### Duplicate Detection Logic

The merge script uses a key-based comparison system:
- **Inspection entries** are compared using: `inspector|day|shift|area`
- **Inspectors, areas, shops** are compared using their unique `id` field
- **Bell notifications** are compared using their unique `id` field

### Shop Duplicate Validation

The script validates that no shop is assigned to multiple inspectors on the same day, but:
- ✅ Validation only applies to dates from **October 7, 2024 onwards**
- ✅ Different shifts on the same day are allowed (morning vs evening)
- ✅ Same shop can be assigned to different inspectors on different days

This ensures data integrity while allowing flexible scheduling when needed.
