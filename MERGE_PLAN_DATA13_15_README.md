## Final State (plan-data.json)

**Total counts after both merges:**
- 📝 **85 inspection entries** (+1 from the merges)
- 👥 **23 inspectors** (+5 from the merges)
- 🏘️ **38 areas** (no change)
- 🏪 **149 shops** (no change)
- 🔔 **5 bell notifications** (no change)
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-08T16:24:47.224963

## Source Files Information

### Before Merge (Initial State)
**plan-data.json:**
- 📝 84 inspection entries
- 👥 18 inspectors
- 🏘️ 38 areas
- 🏪 149 shops
- 🔔 5 bell notifications

**plan-data13.json:**
- 📝 84 inspection entries
- 👥 11 inspectors
- 🏘️ 38 areas
- 🏪 149 shops
- 🔔 5 bell notifications

**plan-data15.json:**
- 📝 84 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️ 38 areas
- 🏪 149 shops
- 🔔 5 bell notifications

## Key Points

1. ✅ **Intelligent Merging**: The merge scripts use smart duplicate detection to avoid data duplication
2. ✅ **Validation**: All merges validate for duplicate shop assignments and only block if NEW duplicates are introduced
3. ✅ **Backups**: Automatic backups were created before each merge operation
4. ✅ **Safe Operations**: The original source files (`plan-data13.json` and `plan-data15.json`) remain unchanged
5. ✅ **Timestamp Updates**: The `lastUpdate` field reflects the most recent merge operation

## Data Consolidation

The merges successfully consolidated:
- **1 unique inspection entry** from plan-data13.json that wasn't in the original plan-data.json
- **5 unique inspectors** from plan-data15.json that weren't in plan-data.json after the first merge
- All existing data from plan-data.json was preserved

## Verification

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (85 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (23 inspectors)
- Area information (38 areas)
- Shop details (149 shops)
- Bell notifications (5 notifications)

## Front Screen Display

✅ The merged `plan-data.json` is the single source of truth for the application  
✅ All inspection data is now consolidated and ready for display  
✅ The application (`index.html`) will automatically load and display the merged data  
✅ No code changes are required - the merge is transparent to the application  

## Usage for Future Merges

To merge additional data files in the future, you can:
1. Create a similar merge script based on `merge_plan_data13.py` or `merge_plan_data15.py`
2. Update the source filename in the script
3. Run the script: `python3 merge_plan_dataXX.py`

The script will:
1. ✅ Create an automatic backup
2. ✅ Merge data intelligently
3. ✅ Avoid duplicates
4. ✅ Validate for conflicts
5. ✅ Update timestamps
6. ✅ Provide detailed merge summary

## Files Modified

- ✅ `plan-data.json` - Updated with merged data from both source files
- ✅ `plan-data.json.backup_20251008_162355` - Backup created before first merge
- ✅ `plan-data.json.backup_20251008_162447` - Backup created before second merge

## Technical Notes

### Duplicate Detection
- The merge scripts use a unique key for inspection entries: `inspector|day|shift|area`
- Inspectors, areas, and shops are deduplicated by their `id` field
- Bell notifications are deduplicated by their `id` field

### Validation Rules
- The validation only applies to dates from October 7, 2024 onwards
- Pre-existing duplicates don't block the merge
- Only NEW duplicates introduced by the merge will cause it to fail

### Data Integrity
- ⚠️ Note: 15 pre-existing duplicate shop assignments were detected (these existed before the merges)
- ✅ No new duplicate shop assignments were introduced by either merge operation
- ✅ All data merging operations completed successfully

## Next Steps

1. ✅ The merged data is ready to be displayed by index.html
2. ✅ All inspection plans from both source files are now available
3. ✅ The application can be accessed and will show all consolidated data
4. ✅ Both source files (`plan-data13.json` and `plan-data15.json`) remain available for reference

## Summary

The merge operations successfully consolidated data from `plan-data13.json` and `plan-data15.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The application is now ready to display the complete inspection data with no code changes required.
