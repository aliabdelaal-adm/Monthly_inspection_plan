# Merge plan-data100.json into plan-data.json

## Overview

This document describes the merge operation that integrates `plan-data100.json` into `plan-data.json` while **replacing** the inspectors list with the 9 official inspectors from PR #269.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created plan-data100.json
   - Contains the 9 official inspectors from PR #269
   - Includes inspection data from October period
   - Based on plan-data10.json structure with correct inspector list

### 2. Created merge script: `merge_plan_data100.py`
   - Based on existing merge scripts (merge_plan_data10.py)
   - Modified to **REPLACE** the inspectors list instead of merging it
   - Implements intelligent duplicate detection for inspection entries
   - Merges areas, shops, and bell notifications without duplicates

### 3. Executed merge operation
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251008_184608`
   - Merged all data from `plan-data100.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - **Replaced** the inspectors list with the 9 official inspectors
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

### 4. Updated test suite
   - Added `plan-data100.json` to `test_pr269_inspectors_linking.py`
   - All tests pass successfully

## Data Verification

### Before Merge

**plan-data.json:**
- 82 inspection entries
- **23 inspectors** (including duplicates and non-official inspectors)
- 38 areas
- 149 shops
- 5 bell notifications

**plan-data100.json:**
- 73 inspection entries
- **9 inspectors** (official inspectors only)
- 29 areas
- 142 shops
- Bell notifications

### Merge Results

**Changes made:**
- ✅ 0 new inspection entries added (no duplicates from plan-data100.json)
- ✅ **Inspectors replaced: 23 → 9** (removed duplicates and non-official inspectors)
- ✅ 0 new areas added (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new shops added (all already present)
- ✅ 0 new bell notifications (all already present)

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)

**Total counts:**
- 📝 **82 inspection entries**
- 👥 **9 inspectors** (official only, no duplicates)
- 🏘️  **38 areas**
- 🏪 **149 shops**
- 🔔 **5 bell notifications**
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-08T18:46:08.027580

**Official inspectors (9):**
1. د. آمنه بن صرم
2. د. آيه سلامة
3. د. حسينة العامري
4. د. حصة العلي
5. د. علي عبدالعال
6. د. فايز المسالمة
7. د. محمد إسماعيل
8. د. محمد سعيد
9. د. هاجر الغافري

## Key Points

1. **Inspector list replaced**: The key difference from other merge scripts is that this script **replaces** the entire inspectors list instead of merging it
2. **No duplicates**: All duplicate inspectors were removed
3. **Official inspectors only**: Only the 9 official inspectors from PR #269 are retained
4. **Inspection data preserved**: All 82 inspection entries are preserved
5. **Connections maintained**: All inspection entries now correctly reference the official inspectors
6. **Data integrity**: All JSON structure and required fields are intact
7. **Automatic backup**: A timestamped backup was created before merging

## Verification

To verify the merge was successful, you can check:

```bash
# Check the merged data
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('plan-data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(f'Inspections: {len(data[\"inspectionData\"])}, Inspectors: {len(data[\"inspectors\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Inspections: 82, Inspectors: 9`

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with:
- All inspection schedules (82 total entries)
- 9 official inspector assignments (no duplicates)
- All connected to their respective inspection schedules
- Area information (38 areas)
- Shop details (149 shops)
- Bell notifications (5 notifications)

## Usage

To run the merge script manually:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Monthly_inspection_plan/Monthly_inspection_plan
python3 merge_plan_data100.py
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify inspector linking:

```bash
python3 test_pr269_inspectors_linking.py
```

Expected result: All tests pass, including plan-data100.json

## Notes

- This merge script is designed to **replace** the inspectors list, not merge it
- The script ensures all inspection data references only official inspectors
- A backup is automatically created before any changes are made
- The merge can be safely re-run as it handles duplicates intelligently
