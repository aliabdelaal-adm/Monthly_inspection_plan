# Merge plan-data3.json into plan-data.json

## Overview
This document describes the merge operation that combined data from `plan-data3.json` into the main `plan-data.json` file. The merged data is now ready to be read and displayed by `index.html`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created merge script: `merge_plan_data3.py`
   - Based on existing `merge_plan_data.py` script
   - Modified to merge `plan-data3.json` instead of `plan-data1.json`
   - Implements intelligent duplicate detection and avoidance

### 2. Executed merge operation
   - Backed up original `plan-data.json` to `plan-data.json.backup_20251003_193346`
   - Merged all data from `plan-data3.json` into `plan-data.json`
   - Updated timestamp to reflect merge time

### 3. Merge Results
   ```
   📝 New inspection entries added: 11
   👥 New inspectors added: 0
   🏘️  New areas added: 0
   🏪 New shops added: 0
   🔔 New notifications added: 0
   ```

## Data Verification

### Before Merge
**plan-data.json:**
- 📝 44 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️  22 areas
- 🏪 114 shops
- 🔔 4 bell notifications

**plan-data3.json:**
- 📝 55 inspection entries
- 👥 9 inspectors
- 🏘️  22 areas
- 🏪 114 shops
- 🔔 4 bell notifications

### After Merge (current plan-data.json)
**Total counts:**
- 📝 **55 inspection entries** (11 new entries added)
- 👥 **9 inspectors** (no changes)
- 🏘️  **22 areas** (no changes)
- 🏪 **114 shops** (no changes)
- 🔔 **4 bell notifications** (no changes)
- 📅 **Last update:** 2025-10-03T19:33:46.588451

## Key Points

1. **Smart Merging**: The script identifies duplicates by checking the combination of `inspector|day|shift|area` to avoid duplicate inspection entries
2. **No Data Loss**: All unique data from plan-data3.json was successfully added to plan-data.json
3. **Data Integrity**: All data structures remain intact and properly formatted
4. **Front Screen Ready**: The merged data is now available in plan-data.json for index.html to read and display

## Verification

✅ Successfully loaded plan-data.json  
✅ All required keys present (inspectionData, inspectors, areas, shops, bellNotes, lastUpdate)  
✅ All required fields present in inspection entries (inspector, day, shift, area, shops)  
✅ All required fields present in bell notifications (id, text, timestamp, author)  
✅ Data structure is fully compatible with index.html  

## Front Screen Display

The application (`index.html`) loads data from `plan-data.json` using:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('./plan-data.json?t=' + Date.now());
```

The merged data will now appear on the front screen with all:
- Inspection schedules (55 total entries)
- Inspector assignments (9 inspectors)
- Area information (22 areas)
- Shop details (114 shops)
- Bell notifications (4 notifications)

## Usage

To merge additional data files in the future, use the `merge_plan_data3.py` script or create a similar script:
```bash
python3 merge_plan_data3.py
```

The script will:
1. Create an automatic backup
2. Merge data intelligently from plan-data3.json
3. Avoid duplicates
4. Update timestamps
5. Provide detailed merge summary

## Notes

- The merge script creates automatic backups before merging (stored as `plan-data.json.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`)
- All inspection data from plan-data3.json that wasn't already in plan-data.json has been added
- Both files can continue to coexist as the merge is non-destructive
- The original `merge_plan_data.py` script can still be used for merging other files
