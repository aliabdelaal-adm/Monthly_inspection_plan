# Solution Summary: Smart Planner Shop Loading Fix

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Issue:** When adding a new inspection in the Smart Planner dashboard, no shops were appearing in the inspector's area, whether available or high-priority shops.

**Root Causes:**
1. Only relying on `shops_details.json`
2. Not showing reserved or recently inspected shops even if they had high priority
3. No clear classification of shops by priority and availability

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Core Fix
Updated the `getAllShopsInArea()` function in `smart-planner.html` to:
1. **Primary Source:** Use `planData.shops` array with `areaId` mapping
2. **Fallback:** Keep backward compatibility with `inspectionData` history
3. **Complete Coverage:** Show ALL shops in an area, not just previously inspected ones

### Code Changes
**File:** `smart-planner.html` (lines 1655-1692)

**Before:**
```javascript
function getAllShopsInArea(area) {
    // Only searched through inspection history
    const shopSet = new Set();
    planData.inspectionData.forEach(inspection => {
        if (inspection.area === area && inspection.shops) {
            inspection.shops.forEach(shop => shopSet.add(shop));
        }
    });
    return Array.from(shopSet);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function getAllShopsInArea(area) {
    // First: Use shops array (primary source)
    if (planData.shops && planData.areas) {
        const areaObj = planData.areas.find(a => a.name === area);
        if (areaObj) {
            const shopsInArea = planData.shops
                .filter(shop => shop.areaId === areaObj.id)
                .map(shop => shop.name);
            if (shopsInArea.length > 0) {
                return shopsInArea; // All shops!
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Fallback: inspection history (backward compatibility)
    // ... (original code for legacy data)
}
```
