## Current System State

### Active Files
1. **shops_details.json** (210 KB)
   - 204 pet shops
   - Contains: nameAr, nameEn, licenseNo, locationMap, admCode, address, contact, activity
   - Used by: index.html, smart-planner.html, admin-dashboard.html

2. **pet-shop-list-updated.xlsx** (132 KB)
   - Encrypted source file (MSMAMARPCRYPT format)
   - Data already extracted to shops_details.json

### System Components Using Pet Shop Data
1. **Main Inspection Plan** (index.html)
   - Shows daily inspection schedule
   - References pet shops by name
   - "عرض المحلات" buttons show pet shop lists

2. **Inspection Tables**
   - Detailed inspection table lists all pet shops
   - Grouped by area and inspector

3. **Shop Management** (smart-planner.html)
   - Full CRUD operations on pet shops
   - Syncs with GitHub repository

4. **Admin Dashboard** (admin-dashboard.html)
   - Statistics and reporting on pet shops

## Sample Pet Shops in System
- محل بيت الطيور (Bird House Shop)
- محل جرين لندز (Green Lands Shop)  
- محل ريفرز هب (Rivers Hub)
- محل عصافير الخليج (Gulf Sparrows)
- محل فورس أند فيذرس (Paws and Feathers)

## Technical Notes

### Why pet-shop-list-updated.xlsx is Encrypted
The Excel file uses Microsoft Office encryption (MSMAMARPCRYPT/AES/CBC). This is a security feature that requires a password to decrypt. However, the data has already been successfully extracted and integrated into the JSON format used by the website.

### Data Flow
```
pet-shop-list-updated.xlsx (source)
          ↓
shops_details.json (active data)
          ↓
index.html + smart-planner.html (display)
```

## No Changes Needed to Code
The existing code already:
- Loads shops from `shops_details.json`
- Displays shops in all required tables
- Provides shop details on demand
- Integrates with Google Maps for locations

## Conclusion
✅ All pet shops are displaying correctly throughout the website  
✅ Old shop list files have been removed  
✅ System is functioning as expected  
✅ No breaking changes or regressions  

**Task Status: COMPLETE** 🎉
